                    <h2 id="eulerian-vs-lagrangian-fluid-simulation">Eulerian vs Lagrangian Fluid Simulation</h2>

            <p>There are two main schools of thought for simulating fluids. The <strong>Lagrangian
            approach</strong> simulates a large number of particles to approximate fluid molecules
            whereas the <strong>Eulerian approach</strong> divides the simulation space into grid cells
            at which we keep track of different fluid properties such as velocity, pressure,
            and temperature.</p>

            <p>The Lagrangian approach can easily simulate small-scale effects since it
            measures properties of the fluid at each individual particle. To mimic this
            level of detail, the Eulerian approach would need to increase the resolution of
            the grid as fluid effects smaller than the size of a grid cell cannot be
            accurately represented.</p>

            <p>In contrast, the Eulerian approach can simulate large-scale effects
            significantly faster as it only needs to maintain the one value per property in
            each grid cell whereas the Lagrangian approach would need to simulate a large
            quantity of particles to fill the each grid cell in order to produce the same
            effect.</p>

            <p>As a midground, there are <strong>hybrid models</strong> that use Eulerian grids overall with
            Lagrangian particles near the surface where there many small-scale fluid
            effects. Alternatively, non-uniform adaptively sampled grids can similarly
            reduce the computational workload while maintaining high levels of resolution
            where needed.</p>

            <p>For the remainder of this article, we'll be focusing on the Eulerian approach
            for incompressible fluids. This article can be seen as my abridged version of
            Robert Bridson's notes / textbook <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-bridson"><a href="#fn-bridson">2</a></sup> and draws some intuition and
            ideas from Foster and Metaxas. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-metaxas"><a href="#fn-metaxas">3</a></sup></p>

            <h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>

            <p>Following the standard notation of fluid simulation texts and literature, we
            denote velocity to be the vector \(\vec{u} = (u, v, w)\) whose components
            correspond to the velocity components in the \(x, y, z\) directions
            respectively. Pressure will be denoted as \(p\) and we'll denote any other
            quantity we keep track of in the grid as \(q\).</p>

            <p>We also define \(\rho\) to be the density of the fluid, \(\eta\) to be the
            dynamic viscosity coefficient and \(\nu = \frac{\eta}{\rho}\) to be the
            kinematic viscosity.</p>

            <h2 id="behavior-of-fluid">Behavior of Fluid</h2>

            <p>The first question we can ask ourselves is how do fluids behave? Or more
            importantly, what forces control the behavior of fluids?</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The immediate answer would be <strong>gravity</strong> (as well as any other external
            forces acting on the fluid) that exerts a downward force on the fluid.
            <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-gravity"><a href="#fn-gravity">1</a></sup></li>
            <li>We also have <strong>pressure</strong> as fluids gradually move from areas of high pressure
            to areas of low pressure.</li>
            <li>And lastly, we have <strong>viscosity</strong> which resists deformation of the fluid.
            Notice that if fluid moves uniformly locally, then that local region would not
            have any deformation. Therefore, viscosity can be seen as a "force" that
            resists non-uniform local movement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="material-derivative">Material Derivative</h2>

            <p>Given that we're measuring quantities on the grid, we need to know how they
            change in order to update their values. Namely, the question we want to answer
            is what is the rate of change of a fluid property at a given location over time?</p>

            <p>Naively, we would think that this would simply be the time derivative of the
            fluid property, but this does not account for fluid movement. Imagine that at a
            grid point \(x\), we have some fluid particles \(f^0\). After we advance one
            time step in the simulation, barring zero velocity at \(x\), those fluid
            particles should have moved to a new location and other fluid particles
            \(f^1\) may have taken its place at \(x\). As a result, the value of the
            measured fluid property at \(x\) is now that of the particles \(f^1\).</p>

            <p>Combining both the time derivative of the property and the fluid flow, we obtain
            the <strong>material derivative</strong>, denoted with a capital D, which is defined as
            follows for a property \(q\) :</p>

            <p>$$\frac{Dq}{Dt} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t}
                + u \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}
                + v \frac{\partial q}{\partial y}
                + w \frac{\partial q}{\partial z}$$</p>

            <p>By multiplying the spatial derivatives of \(q\) with the fluid velocity, we
            additional account for how \(q\) changes as fluid moves through the velocity
            field \(\vec{u}\). We can also write this more succinctly as:</p>

            <p>$$\frac{Dq}{Dt} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \nabla q$$</p>

            <h2 id="putting-everything-together">Putting Everything Together</h2>

            <p>Viewing the material derivative of velocity as acceleration, we want to see how
            it's affected by the three "forces" we described earlier so that we can update
            the velocity field every step.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>In the case of gravity, we accelerate the \(y\) component of \(\vec{u}\)
            by the gravitational constant \(g\) as per usual.</li>
            <li>For pressure, we want to have an acceleration applied to \(\vec{u}\) that
            pushes it towards lower pressure regions. Looking a particular point, we have
            that the gradient of the pressure yields the direction of steepest ascent. In
            order to get desired descent direction, we simply have to negate it.</li>
            <li>For viscosity, we want to resist large differences in velocity in local
            regions. The <strong>Laplacian operator</strong>, \(\nabla^2\), does exactly that when
            applied to the velocity field. See
            <a href="#appendix-the-laplacian-operator">the appendix section</a> for intuition and
            review of the Laplacian operator.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To convert the pressure and viscosity into a force, we integrate these values
            over the volume and the gravitational force is the usual, \(mg\). Putting
            everything together, we have:</p>

            <p>$$m\frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt} = - V \, \nabla p + mg + \eta V \, \nabla^2 \vec{u}$$</p>

            <p>Dividing by volume and then by density, we are left with the first of the
            <strong>Navier-Stokes equations</strong>:</p>

            <p>$$\frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + g + \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u}$$</p>

            <h2 id="incompressibility">Incompressibility</h2>

            <p>The second of the Navier-Stokes equations deals with the <strong>incompressibility</strong>
            constraint of fluids. Namely, we want to preserve the volume as we simulate it.
            This boils down to wanting the amount of fluid that enters a given region to be
            equal to the amount of fluid that leaves it.</p>

            <p>Recalling calculus, this is equivalent to wanting the integral of the normal
            component of the velocity over the boundary of any given region \(\Omega\) to
            be zero:</p>

            <p>$$\iint_{\partial\Omega}\vec{u}\cdot\hat{n} = 0$$</p>

            <p>Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we have that:</p>

            <p>$$\iiint_\Omega\nabla\cdot\vec{u} = 0$$</p>

            <p>Since this has to hold for any region \(\Omega\), we have that:</p>

            <p>Imagine first that we put the velocity values in the center of the grid cells
            and approximate the derivative with central differencing. Central differencing
            is preferred over forwards or backwards differencing because it doesn't have a
            left or right bias and the error term is \(O(n^2)\) rather than \(O(n)\).
            However, it comes with a small problem:</p>

            <p>$$u_i' \approx \frac{u_{i + 1} - u_{i - 1}}{2\Delta x}$$</p>

            <p>Notice that in order to calculate the derivative at \(u_i\) we use only the
            values of the adjacent values \(u_{i - 1}\) and \(u_{i + 1}\), but we ignore
            the value at \(u_i\). As a result, this can lead to some bizarre artifacts and
            behavior. In order to resolve this, we use the standard discretization via the
            <strong>Marker-and-Cell grid</strong> popularized in Harlow and Welch in 1965. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-macgrid"><a href="#fn-macgrid">4</a></sup></p>

            <figcaption class="figure" id="counter-ref-macgrid"><strong>Figure&nbsp;1</strong>: MAC Grid (from Bridson's notes)</figcaption>

            <p>Notice how in Figure <a class="figure" href="#counter-ref-macgrid">1</a>, that the velocity values are placed on the
            edges of the cells and the pressure values are placed in the center. By placing
            the velocity values at the edges (denoted by the \(u_{i - \frac{1}{2}}\) for
            the left edge and \(u_{i + \frac{1}{2}}\) for the right edge), we no longer
            have the issue from before when taking the derivative at the center of the cell.
            Namely:</p>

            <p>$$u_i' \approx \frac{u_{i + \frac{1}{2}} - u_{i - \frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta x}$$</p>

            <p>Notice how this does not have any missing values in between (as there we are not
            keeping track of the value in the cell center, \(u_i\)). Should we want the
            velocity at that location, we can simply interpolate the edge values.</p>

            <p>When we compute the pressure gradient to update the velocity values, notice
            that we can easily use central differencing at the edges since the pressure
            values are kept at the cell centers.</p>

            <h3 id="grid-cells">Grid Cells</h3>

            <p>For the sake of simplicity, we'll categorize each of the cells as <strong>solid</strong>,
            <strong>empty</strong>/<strong>air</strong>, or <strong>fluid</strong>. This limits us to having solids that perfectly
            align with the grid cells and that all walls and boundaries perfectly align with
            the axes.</p>

            <h2 id="boundary-conditions">Boundary Conditions</h2>

            <p>As with every set of differential equations, Eulerian fluid simulation has
            several boundary conditions to consider, but the two basic requirements are the
            boundary between fluid and air and the boundary between fluid and solids.</p>

            <h3 id="fluid-air-boundary">Fluid-Air Boundary</h3>

            <p>The boundary between fluid and air represents atmospheric effects as well as any
            forces that result from wind or pressure differences. In general, air pressure
            is so small that it has a negligible effect and we can just ignore it.</p>

            <h3 id="fluid-solid-boundary-normal-component">Fluid-Solid Boundary (Normal Component)</h3>

            <p>For the boundary between fluid and solids, we first look at the normal component
            of the velocity field. For the 2D case, if the fluid is to the right or the left
            of the solid, we're looking at the \(x\) component of the velocity vector. If
            the fluid is above or below the solid, we're looking at the \(y\) component of
            the velocity vector.</p>

            <p>Since we don't want the fluid to enter the solid cells, we want the relative
            normal velocity between the fluid and solid to be zero. Notice that we're
            dealing with the relative velocity because if the solid is moving, the fluid
            velocity of the fluid at their boundary can move up to the solid's velocity
            without entering the solid cell.</p>

            <p>Of course, if the solid is stationary, then we set the normal velocity to be
            zero.</p>

            <h3 id="fluid-solid-boundary-tangential-component">Fluid-Solid Boundary (Tangential Component)</h3>

            <p>In addition, there is also the tangential component of the fluid velocity with
            respect to the solid. In the 2D case, it's the non-normal direction and in the
            3D case, it's both of the non-normal directions.</p>

            <p>If we leave the tangential component alone, collisions will still not occur, and
            the fluid can freely travel along the side of the solids. This is called a
            <strong>free-slip boundary</strong>.</p>

            <p>If we set the tangential component to zero, the fluid will completely halt upon
            collision and this is called a <strong>no-slip boundary</strong>.</p>

            <p>If the boundary is set to be between the free-slip and the no-slip boundary,
            this is effectively the same as having a solid that's kind of sticky or one that
            applies a friction force on the fluid that slows it down as it travels against
            it.</p>

            <h2 id="appendix-the-laplacian-operator">Appendix: The Laplacian Operator</h2>

            <p>The Laplacian operator is typically written as \(\nabla^2\), but it is
            equivalently defined as the divergence of the gradient, \(\nabla^2 f = \nabla
            \cdot \nabla f\). It effectively computes how much a value varies from the
            average value within a small neighborhood.</p>

            <p>A simple way to understand what the Laplacian does is to look at its discrete
            estimate:</p>

            <p>$$\nabla^2 f(x, y) \approx \frac{f(x - h, y) + f(x + h, y) + f(x, y - h) + f(x, y + h) - 4 f(x, y)}{h^2}$$</p>

            <p>Notice that when \(f(x, y)\) is more positive than its neighbors, the
            Laplacian is a negative value and when it is more negative than its neighbors,
            the Laplacian is a positive value. When it is close to its neighbors, the
            Laplacian is then close to zero.</p>

            <p>From this we can see that whenever the value at a given point is far away from
            its neighbors, then the Laplacian at that point pushes it towards the average
            value. As a result, this intuitively makes sense that it corresponds with the
            viscosity when applied to the velocity field as it would nudge velocity values
            towards the local average to increase local uniformity and therefore resist
            deformation.</p>

            <p>In the next article in this series, we'll discuss how to update the state, solve
            constraints, and render the fluid.</p>
