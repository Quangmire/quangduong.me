## BIO

I'm a first year CS Ph.D student at UT Austin starting in the Fall of 2020. My
hobbies include reading anything from high fantasy to romance, belting out songs
in the shower whenever I'm fully convinced there is no one around to hear my
caterwauling, and indulging in the world's two highest forms of humor--puns and
self-deprecation. I can commonly be found ricing his Arch distro, entertaining
ridiculous research and project ideas, or redesigning this website for the
umpteenth time in procrastination of upcoming deadlines.
