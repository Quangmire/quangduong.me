summary: >
  A series of notes summarizing the different approaches taken in the past
  half-century to perform spatial and temporal data prefetching in CPU caches.
  In short, a growing literature review of the field that summarizes these
  authors' works.

---

This series details my notes on various research papers (some dating back 40+
years ago) on data prefetching. Some entries will appear in several categories
below as they encompass multiple approaches. It's currently a WIP, but there's
definitely more to come.

## Spatial Prefetching

TBD

## Temporal Prefetching

TBD

## Machine Learning Approaches

TBD
