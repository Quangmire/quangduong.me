Salutations! This is the repository holding my GitHub Pages website. Fancy meeting you here intrepid stranger. Enjoy your stay.

##Just a Notice
Although I'm being a tad presumptuous that anyone would use this theme,  you will have to build it offline before pushing it to GitHub Pages
because GitHub does not use the plugins present (Note the nojekyll file). For any other, regular hosting, it should be fine to
build it online. Good day. -tips hat- (Should you actually use the theme, sent me a link. -wink-).

##Many Thanks To the Following

+ Hyde is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme used. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and is made by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo). 
  It's under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md). My theme borrows a lot of inspiration and used this as a base.
+ This [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26073090/how-to-retrieve-the-current-post-index-number-in-jekyll) for its ruby code
  that facilitated post indexing (although it can be brute forced).
+ This [blog post](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/) for the ruby tagging system.
