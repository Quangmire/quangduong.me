summary: >
  A series of notes on different methods and approaches to fluid simulations
  ranging from Eulerian to Lagrangian to neural approximations. The goal is to
  demystify how these approaches work and make information about them more
  accessible.

---

This series details my notes on different methods and approaches to fluid
simulation from Eulerian to Lagrangian to neural approximations. It's currently
a WIP, but there's definitely more to come.

## Eulerian Fluid Simulation

Eulerian fluid simulations divide the simulated space into discrete grid cells
at which we keep track of various fluid properties such as velocity, pressure,
temperature and so forth. The grid cells do not need be uniform and a large body
of research focuses on subdividing the grid adaptively as needed to get the
desired level of detail without losing performance.
