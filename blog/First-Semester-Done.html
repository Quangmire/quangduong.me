  <h1 class="post-title">First Semester Done Part 1!</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><span>Feb. 8,  2016</span></span>
  <p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to write this for awhile, but I just never got around to over
the (very appreciated) winter break. The entirety of my first fall semester was
not only enlightening, but also packed with endless projects and assignments as
expected. I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>The first day was absolutely insane. There were far more people wandering the
streets than I have ever seen in any given space (although much to my chagrin
this dwindled by the end of the week). Furthermore, a large portion of one of 
the main roads was filled with hundreds of student organizations, facilitating
the illusion of a bustling street (which it was). Throughout this first week,
the one distinct thing I can remember is that there was free food everywhere I
looked and I voraciously ate it all.</p>

<p>In my classes themselves, the assignments given in my sole programming course,
Data Structures, proved not too difficult in any regard, but the style and
rigor in which we had to complete them made each very challenging. For each
one, we were required to verbalize our work in a report and to write extensive
testing code to verify the internal workings of the program (in addition to the
code actually doing what it was intended to do). I won&#39;t go into the details of
the assignments themselves (in honor of the next generation), despite some of 
the results of the first being visible in the previous blog post, but I do want
to say that they were truly diverse and quite fun to implement.</p>

<p>The other main classes I took this semester, Discrete Mathematics and Vector
Calculus, had a much lighter workload, albeit a larger learning curve to the
knowledge being presented. While vector cal was mainly just a multi-dimensional
extension to the calculus that I&#39;ve learned before, discrete math was a whole
new animal that I was not accustomed to with all its proofs and tangentially
related number/graph theorems. I&#39;d be drastically selling short by saying that
everything could be illustrated as a few steps from point A to point B, but
once you got the hang of it, you could <span class="pic" w="300" h="225">
<a href="/public/images/memes/see_the_ending.jpg">see the solution</a>.</span></p>

<p>My two remaining classes, Introduction to Ancient Greece and The Pursuit of 
Happiness in Shakespeare, were initially taken to fulfill basic core 
requirements, but they proved to be a source of endlessly interesting 
information. The Greece class exposed me to different types of ancient 
architecture and the standard epics of Homer, but I most enjoyed reading 
excerpts from Aristophanes, a fantastic comedian, who constantly ridiculed the 
serious tragedians and the &quot;faultless&quot; politicians of Athens. Imagine an 
ancient Greek rendition of Stephen Colbert or John Stewart (now sorrowfully, 
but not inadequately replaced with Trevor Noah). Shakespeare on the other hand
let me appreciate what I never thought I would...his plays. The lesser known
comedies were a myriad of social satire and biting wit that it so worthwhile.
In particular, the &quot;misogynistic&quot; <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> demonstrated a 
hysterical, but nonetheless valuable commentary on how women were treated at
the time (which links to Euripides obsession with women in his plays).</p>

<p>To be later continued in Part 2</p>
