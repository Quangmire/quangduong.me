summary: >
  A series of notes summarizing the different approaches taken in the past
  half-century to perform spatial and temporal data prefetching in CPU caches.
  In short, a growing literature review of the field that summarizes these
  authors' works.

---

```Python
def a(b):
    b = b + 1
    return 2 * b

def main():
    a(a(a(a(5))))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This series details my notes on various research papers (some dating back 40+
years ago) on data prefetching. Some entries will appear in several categories
below as they encompass multiple approaches. It's currently a WIP, but there's
definitely more to come.

## Spatial Prefetching

TBD

## Temporal Prefetching

TBD

## Machine Learning Approaches

TBD
