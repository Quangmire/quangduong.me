title: About Me
---
Hiya! I am currently an incoming student into the UT Austin, entering their infamous Computer Science 
program (best put as the best computer science department for 1,000 miles). This sets me at 18 years 
of age right now. I've decided to use this github pages site to host all of my musings and developmental
progress. Enjoy your stay here intrepid stranger! (And if you haven't caught it yet, my name's Quang Duong).

#Current Projects
* This website. Just look at it. It's atrocious.
* TBD

#Random Facts
* I absolutely enjoy reading fantasy, science fiction (steam punk :D), with a smidgeon of adventure, and
  a tad of romance.
* Self-Acclaimed League Player (ARAM mostly...a lot of ARAM) with an IGN of (wait for it...) Quangmire.
* A bit too much of an Otaku (even trying to learn Japanese)
* Also attempting to double major in Mathematics. Note the "attempting" part. It's a key word.
* Of average height (in malnourished oriental countries of course)
