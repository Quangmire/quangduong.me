## Salutations Intrepid Explorer

I see you have found your way to my dusty corner of the Internet and I humbly
welcome you into my modest abode. Here is where I compile my longer term
personal projects with my shorter term chronocides together with blog posts
about anything interesting that I have come across and notes I have taken
thoughout my college career (and likely long afterward). This website is moreso
to organize my thoughts, but feel free to come along for the ride.

## In Regards to this Website

By no means is this website completed in terms of design. This is the fourth or
fifth incarnation at this point and it suffers constant updates with my changing
tastes. Despite the number of rewrites, I am completely certain this website is
not free of bugs so feel free to send any error reports my way as they are
greatly appreciated.

## Final Thoughts

I hope you enjoy your stay and wish you the best during these trying
quarantine-ridden times.
