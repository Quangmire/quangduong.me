*-shakes hand with mysterious reader with a hearty smile-*   
This marks the beginning of my dev blog. I'll try to consistently post updates to all the

I already have a few game and application ideas to throw around, so look forward to some soon to
come excitement! Also, Happy 4th of July (or National Traitors Day to any readers claiming ancestry
to the British Empires).
