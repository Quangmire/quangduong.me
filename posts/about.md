## BIO

I'm a CS Ph.D student at UT Austin as of Fall 2020. My hobbies include reading
anything from high fantasy to romance, belting out songs in the shower whenever
I'm fully convinced there is no one around to hear my caterwauling, and
indulging in the world's two highest forms of humor--puns and self-deprecation.
I can commonly be found ricing my Arch distro, entertaining ridiculous research
and project ideas, or redesigning this website for the umpteenth time as my
tastes in aesthetics change.

Pictured on the right is my mostly black and a smidge white munchkin cat,
Chickadee.

## RESEARCH INTERESTS

- Machine Learning for Computer Architecture Prediction Tasks
- Saliency and Distillation
- NLP / AI / ML / Data Science in General
